<p>Welcome to College of Science and Technology of The University of Cambodia. For everyone who wishes to pursue for any AA and BA degrees of the study programs, please register now or visit the campus of The University of Cambodia.</p>
<p>Data science combines statistical tools, methods, and technology to generate meaning from data. Artificial Intelligence takes this one step further and uses the data to solve cognitive problems commonly associated with human intelligence, such as learning, pattern recognition, and human-like expression.</p>
<h2>Program Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>Main goals of the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence department are to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Apply data science theory and software development fundamentals to produce AIbased solutions</li>
<li>Determine an algorithm’s efficiency, computability and resource usage.</li>
<li>Utilize the latest tools and technologies in data science and AI to develop creative and innovative solutions.</li>
<li>Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program’s discipline.</li>
<li>Conduct scientific research and practical projects that produce significant AI software solutions</li>
</ol>
